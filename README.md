PowerSlash to SMC compiler

I'm currently working on PowerSlash documentation. You'll see it here once it's finished.

To compile a program, create a file with your program in the source code directory. Then, navigate to this directory and run this in a terminal:
```
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh filename.pwsl
```
Replace `filename.pwsl` with your file's name.

The compiled program will be saved in `./output/filename.smc`.
